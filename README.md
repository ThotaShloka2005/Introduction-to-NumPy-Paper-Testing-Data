Overview
This project/tutorial provides an introduction to NumPy, a fundamental Python library for numerical computing, and demonstrates its application in analyzing paper testing data. The goal is to familiarize users with NumPyâ€™s core functionalities while working on real-world data related to the quality testing of paper products

What You Will Learn
Basics of NumPy arrays and operations

Data manipulation using NumPy

Loading and handling paper testing datasets

Performing statistical analysis on paper quality metrics

Visualizing results using simple plots (optional)

Paper Testing Data
The dataset includes measurements collected from paper samples to evaluate their quality attributes such as:

Thickness

Weight

Strength

Moisture content

These measurements help assess the overall quality and performance of paper products.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numpy-paper-testing.git
Install required packages:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
Usage
Load the paper testing data using NumPy or Pandas.

Use NumPy functions to clean, transform, and analyze the data.

Run provided scripts or notebooks to perform sample analyses:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python analysis.py
(Optional) Generate plots to visualize data trends and results.

Example
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

# Load sample data
data = np.loadtxt('paper_testing_data.csv', delimiter=',')

# Calculate average thickness
avg_thickness = np.mean(data[:, 0])
print(f"Average Thickness: {avg_thickness:.2f}")
